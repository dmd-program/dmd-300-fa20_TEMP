# Animation projects

## Types of animation projects

Animation projects can be fully 2D, 3D, or a combination of the two.

1. Short film 
2. Explainer animation \([Vox](https://www.youtube.com/user/voxdotcom) makes a lot of fun infographic style videos\)
3. Motion graphics \(bumper animations, commercials, titles, user interface elements in 3D environments\)
4. Experimental: [Examples on vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/categories/experimental)
5. Scientific or data-driven simulations and visualizations
6. VJ loops for live performances
7. Projection mapping
8. Web-based animation \(HTML/CSS/Javascript\)

**Note about animated short films:** Short films can often be one of the most compelling means of storytelling. They can sometimes be completed by one person over the course of multiple years, or by a skilled team in a few short months. It is unusual for a short film to be quickly created by only one person, as there are many production requirements that take time to produce. If you would like to create a short film, consider assembling a team with complimentary skills, or choose an animation process and style that can be rapidly produced if you are working solo. You can outsource pre- or post-production tasks and focus on your core production interest.

### Production requirements

The following are common production requirements for most types of animations, and may include more or fewer depending on the project. They can also occur in different orders, but in general, if these steps are followed, you are more likely to produce a successful animation.

After creating a script and storyboard, you will have to choose one or more software tools to create your video and audio elements. If you're unsure which of the following software to use, ask your instructor!

### Proof of concept

The goal of an animation proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software and show that you can a strong grasp of animation principles. Choose one of the following based on your project interests:

1. **Traditional keyframe animation:** Demonstrate knowledge of keyframe animation and 12 principles by creating a few seconds of animation using a character or other content from your proposal concept. ToonBoom is the industry standard animation package, but others are acceptable.
2. **Motion design:** Create a few seconds of rendered animation using a 2D animation package like Adobe AfterEffects or 3D software such as Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya, or similar. You can also achieve motion design for the web using Adobe Animate CC.
3. **Other animations:** Create an example animatic \(blocked animation and sound\), animated character rig, or other animated asset relevant to your concept that demonstrates you can complete the core technical challenge of the project.
