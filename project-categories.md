# Project categories

A typical capstone project will fall within one of the following categories. Each category lists its own set of recommended production requirements and expectations for a proof of concept. It is possible to develop a project idea that does not fall within a particular category. Please contact your instructor if you feel your project is not adequately addressed in the options below:

* [Animation](/animation.md)
* [Realtime and interactive](/realtime-and-interactive.md)
* [Product, service, UI/UX](/product-service-uiux.md)
* [2D / 3D design and illustration](/2d-3d-design-and-illustration.md)
* [Audio/Video production](/video-production.md)
* [Art or design intervention](/art-or-design-intervention.md)
